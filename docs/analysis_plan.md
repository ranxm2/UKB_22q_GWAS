# Analysis Plan for UKB_22q_GWAS

## Overview

This document outlines the analysis plan for conducting GWAS studies on 22q11.2 deletion syndrome using UK Biobank data.

## Objectives

1. Identify genetic associations with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome
2. Characterize phenotypic differences in carriers vs non-carriers
3. Perform pathway analysis on significant genetic variants
4. Validate findings using independent datasets
